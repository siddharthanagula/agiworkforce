   - `VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN`
   - `VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
   - `VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE`
   - `VITE_APP_URL`
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch
4. Custom domain: Set `agiworkforce.com` as your custom domain

### Option 2: Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
4. Custom domain: Set `agiworkforce.com` as your custom domain

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist` folder to your web server

## üîß Environment Variables for Production

### Required Variables
```env
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
VITE_APP_URL=https://agiworkforce.com
```

### Optional Variables

```

## üîí Security Considerations

### 1. HTTPS Only
- Ensure your production domain uses HTTPS
- Auth0 requires HTTPS for production

### 2. Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use your hosting platform's environment variable system

### 3. Auth0 Configuration
- Use production Auth0 application (not development)
- Monitor Auth0 logs for suspicious activity
- Regularly review and update security settings

## üß™ Testing Production Deployment

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. Navigate to `https://agiworkforce.com`
2. Click "Sign in with Email" or "Sign in with GitHub"
3. Complete the authentication flow
4. Verify redirect to dashboard

### 2. Protected Routes
1. Try accessing `https://agiworkforce.com/dashboard` without authentication
2. Should redirect to login page
3. After login, should access dashboard successfully

### 3. Logout Flow
1. Click logout button
2. Should redirect to landing page
3. Should not be able to access protected routes

## üêõ Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Invalid redirect URI"
- Check Auth0 dashboard settings
- Ensure production URLs are configured
- Verify HTTPS is enabled

#### 2. "Access denied"
- Check CORS settings in Auth0
- Verify web origins are configured
- Check browser console for errors

#### 3. "Auth0 is not properly configured"
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check that production build includes variables
- Ensure no typos in domain or client ID

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Auth0 dashboard logs
3. Test with different browsers
4. Check network requests in browser dev tools

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Auth0 Dashboard
- Monitor login attempts
- Check for failed authentications
- Review user activity logs

### Application Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track user engagement
